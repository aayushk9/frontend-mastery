queue is where your completed async operatiosn stay until therui chance to go inside stack comes, so when we have code runnin
in call stack and when any async operation is supposed to run js assigns it to web apis in browser adn call stack continues 
to run the further code, so those web apis run and execute, so after execution they get redirected to stay inside queues
so if multiple async operatiosn are running and after completion the need to stay inside queue until stack is empty

so queue has 2 things render queue and callback queue

so when multiple async operatiosna re completed and call stack is not empty we keep them in callback queue and once 
call stack is empty we move one async operation inside render queue and than to stack so again stack is smpety we
move one async from callback to queue and tahn to call stack, the goes on, so we should not write slop asyn code which might
slow the executiuons


event loop assigns micrortask first to stack adn than macro
