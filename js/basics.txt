var, const and let
use let when you wanna update that variable after initializing, mostly used on Loops
use const whenever you are storing something and need not update later and have strictness
var (avoid, may cause errors in prod due to its nature (can update later, avoids referene erros if declared before initialization))

=, == and ===
 = is used for assigning
 == for comparing after type conversationhistory
 === to compare values as well as types


 Primitive types and reference types

 primitves are 
 - string 
 - number
 - boolean
 - null 
 - undefined
 - bigInt
 - symbol

reference types are
 - Arrays
 - object
 - function
 - date 
 - map 
 - set, etc


 what is lexical scope?
 lexical is where code is written, In javascript scope is declared on write time not run time, 

 function outer() {
  let a = 10;

  function inner () {
    console.log(a);
  }
 }

 innder will display 10 because innder is calling variable which is defined, inner can access a because it’s lexically inside outer

 REVERSE IS not possible
 function outer() {
    let a= 10;
 }

 function secondOuter() {
    console.log(a)
 }

 we cannot access a inside second outer as it is calling a from sibling function which is not lexical

 WHAT IS BLOCK SCOPE & FUNCTION SCOPE?

 block scope means the code is not able to run because something is not letting it run/blocking such as

 if(true) {
    let a = 10;
 }

 console.log(a); // a is not lexcial and is defined and assigned in if {} and cannot be used outside if wann use outside define globally
 and use wherever you want it will excape block scope as it is lexical globally
 
 this is blocked because we are using let here which does not allow such expressions to run 
 blocks = {} if, for, while, {}

 FUNCTION SCOPED

 if(true){
    var x = 10
 }

 console.log(x);

 this is will execute and log x as we are using var who nature does not support block scope in other way const/let support block scoping
 This is why let/const fixed tons of JS footguns.
